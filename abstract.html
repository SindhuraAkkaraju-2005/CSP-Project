        This Community Service Project is based on the topic <strong>"Genes and Generations: Spreading Awareness on Genetic Disorders"</strong>. The main goal of our project is to create awareness among people about human genetics and how certain diseases can be passed from one generation to another.
        <br><br>
        Many people are unaware that common health issues like diabetes (commonly called 'sugar'), high blood pressure, heart diseases, asthma, and even some types of cancer can run in families due to genetic factors.
        <br><br>
        Through this project, we aim to educate people about these inherited conditions, how they occur, and the importance of early detection and regular health checkups. We also want to inform people about genetic counseling, healthy lifestyle choices, and the role of family history in understanding personal health risks.
        <br><br>
        As part of this awareness campaign, we plan to interact with people in our community and share useful information through pamphlets, discussions, and digital resources. Our final output will be an easy-to-use website that provides simple explanations and awareness materials to help people understand if they might be at risk of any inherited diseases.
        <br><br>
        By doing this project, we hope to promote better health awareness and encourage people to take preventive steps for themselves and their families.
