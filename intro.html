    <h1>üî¨ Introduction to Genetics</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever wondered why you might look like your parents, or why certain diseases run in families? The answer lies in genes ‚Äî the tiny, powerful units inside your body that carry the instructions for life.
    </p>

    <h2>üß¨ What Are Genes?</h2>
    <p>
      Genes are small sections of DNA that act like instruction manuals for your body. These instructions decide everything from your eye color and height to how your body functions. Every person has thousands of genes that are passed from their parents to them ‚Äî this is why you may share features with your mother, father, or grandparents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genes live inside structures called chromosomes, which are found in the nucleus of every cell in your body.

    <h2>üßæ Understanding Chromosomes</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine chromosomes as big folders that hold many genetic "files" (genes). Every healthy human has 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs ‚Äî you inherit one set of 23 from your mother and one set from your father.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chromosomes 1‚Äì22 are called autosomes</li>
      <li>The 23rd pair determines your sex ‚Äî XX for females and XY for males</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If there‚Äôs an extra or missing chromosome, or if the genes on the chromosomes are changed or damaged, it can lead to a genetic disorder.
    </p>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è What Are Genetic Disorders?</h2>
    <p>
      Genetic disorders are health conditions caused by abnormalities in your genes or chromosomes. Some of these are inherited from parents, while others happen due to sudden changes in genes (mutations) during cell division.
    </p>
    <p>There are different types of genetic disorders based on how they occur:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Single-Gene Disorders</strong><br />These occur when a single gene is mutated or missing.<br /><em>Example: Sickle Cell Anemia, Cystic Fibrosis, Thalassemia</em></li>
      <li><strong>Chromosomal Disorders</strong><br />These occur due to missing, extra, or damaged chromosomes.<br /><em>Example: Down Syndrome (extra chromosome 21), Turner Syndrome (missing X chromosome in females)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Multifactorial Disorders</strong><br />These are caused by a combination of multiple genes and environmental factors like diet, lifestyle, or pollution.<br /><em>Example: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Cancer</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>üß¨ How Do Genetic Disorders Occur?</h2>
    <p>Genetic disorders can happen in three major ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inherited from Parents</strong> ‚Äì If one or both parents carry faulty genes, they can pass them to their children.</li>
      <li><strong>Spontaneous Mutations</strong> ‚Äì Sometimes genes get damaged or copied incorrectly during reproduction, even if the parents are healthy.</li>
      <li><strong>Chromosomal Abnormalities</strong> ‚Äì If a baby has too many or too few chromosomes, or if parts of chromosomes are broken or rearranged, this leads to disorders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí° Why Is This Important?</h2>
    <p>
      Many people don‚Äôt realize that common problems like diabetes, asthma, or even some cancers can run in families due to genetics. Knowing your family‚Äôs medical history and understanding how genes work helps you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Take early action for prevention</li>
      <li>Go for genetic counseling if needed</li>
      <li>Make lifestyle changes to reduce risk</li>
    </ul>
